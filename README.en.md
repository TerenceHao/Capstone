# Enhancement and Feature Integration of Office Automation Management System

## Project Description
The project is based on an existing Spring Boot Office Automation Management System, aiming to expand and enhance its functions to meet broader enterprise needs.

The original system includes basic features such as personnel management, department management, approval processes, and role assignments. However, it lacks advanced features like multi-user role support, message notifications, announcement publishing, user feedback, and multi-language support. This project aims to improve and expand these functionalities.

## Proposed Improvements
- **Role Management Extension**: Add more roles (e.g., department manager, project leader) and configure permissions accordingly.
- **Message Notifications**: Integrate real-time message notifications for critical events.
- **Feedback Module**: Add a feedback module for user suggestions.
- **Announcement Publishing**: Enable announcement publishing on the homepage.
- **Knowledge Sharing Module**: Introduce a module for efficient resource distribution and sharing.
- **Frontend Optimization**: Optimize the frontend for better responsiveness and multi-language support.

## Project Impact
These improvements will enhance the system's flexibility, security, and usability, making it more suitable for the needs of global enterprises and improving team collaboration and overall user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js (i18n, WebSocket)
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, MyBatis, MySQL (JavaMail, WebSocket, file storage)
